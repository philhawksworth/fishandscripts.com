After a spell of Phil being the grump, this festive episode features a grumpy Jack who has had his feathers ruffled by Twitter tropes. Meanwhile Phil shares some of his opinions and observations after starting to use Tailwind for utility-first CSS, we talk about what excites us in 2020.

Thanks so much for your support in 2019 as we launched the podcast - it's been fantastic to hear that people enjoy the show and find our ramblings amusing and even informative every now and then! We wish you all a very happy Christmas and New Year. We'll be back in 2020 with more podcasts, more names for Phil's cats, and more quickly invented, poorly thought through games.
