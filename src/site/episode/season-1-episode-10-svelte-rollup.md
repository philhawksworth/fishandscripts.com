It's a new year but the same pod as we're back talking in more detail about Svelte and Rollup after Jack tried rebuilding the Fish and Scripts site over Christmas. Phil has been merging his favourite tools - Eleventy and TailwindCSS - into a new fancy starter template on GitHub and we dive into our 2020 resolutions which largely centre around us being better adults and taking responsibility for our lives...

Thank you again for the amazing support in 2019 and we're so excited to see what 2020 brings for the show. We love all your comments, feedback and suggestions so do feel free to get in touch.
