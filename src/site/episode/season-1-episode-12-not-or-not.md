For this episode of Fish and Scripts Phil and Jack happily welcomed special guests Jake and Surma, from the [HTTP 203 podcast](https://developers.google.com/web/shows/http203).

Together we talk about the computer games and activities which have been keeping us busy. We discuss the differences between web sites and web apps. We explore developments in browser resource caching with Safari's double keying. And lots more.

Mostly, you'll want to play along with "Not or Not", the cruel quiz which Jake and Surma brought along in an attempt to humiliate us.

As always you'll find links to everything mentioned down below in the show notes and you can get us on Twitter:
