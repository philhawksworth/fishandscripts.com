Today's episode features a grumpy Phil who bemoans the page weight of Apple's AirPod Pro marketing site and we chat about how the web is impacted by leading companies creating pages like this. We chat about URLs and how much users care about them before moving onto Jack's first time properly diving into CSS Grid - where we get stuck understanding margins and padding - and talk about React Suspense and how the surface area of what React is offering is getting larger and more complex...
