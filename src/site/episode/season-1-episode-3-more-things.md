We're back with another episode of Fish and Scripts! Today we're slightly less technical than normal and talking about investing in gear to make conference and other trips abroad more productive. Phil talks about his adventures at Smashing Conf Toronto (including the local cuisine he _didn't_ manage to sample) and Jack goes full programming geek and talks about his new programming _font_!
