Today we're diving into a variety of topics including _other podcasts_ that we like (although we're sure Fish and Scripts fills your entire podcasting needs) before Jack shares a frustrating story of TypeScript which lead to him _actually removing it_ from a project. Phil shares his delight in the Vue community and enjoyment of recent Vue conferences and we talk about onboarding developers into a new team: what do you team them and how do you make that process as smooth as possible?
