Is this thing on? Hello? One two three...

Welcome to the first episode of Fish and Scripts! Today we're getting our feet under the table and making ourselves at home. We introduce ourselves as your glamorous hosts before diving into things we've been finding interesting on the internet recently including GraphQL, Lazy loading of images, Svelte 3 and a game so cunning you could stick a tail on it and call it a weasel.

You can find us on the internet in a number of ways and we'd love to hear from you whether it's to say hello, share some feedback or suggest future topics, don't hold back!
