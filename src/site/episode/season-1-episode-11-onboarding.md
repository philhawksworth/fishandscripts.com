It's been a while and we're truly sorry about that - real life reared its head and left us both a bit busy for recording and editing - but we are back! In this episode Jack talks about settling into a new role, Phil discusses the pros and cons of live coding and we dive into onboarding yourself into a new codebase and tips for how to get familiar and productive.

We promise the next episode will be out sooner than three months, and hope you're all keeping well in these current uncertain times.
