In this episode we reflect on how much fun it was to both be at the lovely Fronteers conference in Amsterdam and talk about some of our highlights from the event. We also wax lyrical about that tricky balancing act between shipping features fast and agonising over achieving high enough quality. And we swoon over the delicious walnut veneer and other features of Garageband.
